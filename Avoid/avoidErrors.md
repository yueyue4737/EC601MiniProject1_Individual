## The following is based on why I confused about my teammates' coursework. It might include critical thinking, but it will never change each one's contribution.


* Do not change your topic from images to texts simply for making it easy.

* For the beginners, we need to learn from one library first, and then expand.

* Never split the work, every one need to know the procedure from 0 to 1, even though some of them are done by specific one.

* Do not use the combination of Chinese and English in your coursework, except in infromal oral speaking.

* Format your markdown file, instead of saying everything is easy.
